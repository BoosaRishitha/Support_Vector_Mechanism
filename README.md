# Support_Vector_Mechanism

# Project Title :
Using the Support Vector Mechanism Algorithm of supervised machine learning, predict iris.csv datasets to find out species will be same od different.

# Problem Statement :
A American waist botnical garden grow iris flower in their labs but using bio technology in a single tree different types of variety flower is grow. As a Data Science Engineer find out how much accuracy is their all categories contains same species.

# Task-1 :
Preprocess with the data in skit.learn library.
# Task-2 :
Load the data using sklearn model selection default arguement.
# Task-3 :
On the basis of datasets train, test, and split SVM model.
# Task-4 :
Implement Support Vector Mechanism Classifier using svm_classifier. The svm must be "Linear".
# Task-5 :
Train the classifier on the training data
# Task-6 :
Find out the prediction value on the test data.
# Task-7 :
Test the model with the help of accuracy, accuracy should be lie in the range of 0 to 1.

# Accuracy :

# Conclusion :
According to my support vector mechanism model the species or linear. With the accuracy of 1.00.
Hence proved model was successfully implement.
